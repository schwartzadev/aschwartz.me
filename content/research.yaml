 - title: Combining Word Embeddings for Binary Classification Tasks
   description: >-
     md//[This article](Schwartz--Combined-Word-Embeddings--Jan-2020.pdf)
     explores the potential of combining two word-level vector representations,
     or word embeddings, for binary classification Natural Language Processing tasks.
     This research considers [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/),
     [ELMo](https://allennlp.org/elmo), and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) embeddings
     and compares the classification ability of a single embedding with the classification
     ability of the same embedding and an additional embedding on a single data set. Drafted, not published.

 - title: Political Emails Data Set
   description: >-
     md//In January 2020, I began collecting campaign emails from over 600 U.S. House of
     Representatives congressional campaigns. I am currently collecting these emails to
     form a corpus of political emails for use in the Natural Language Processing community.
     I hope this dataset will help answer questions such as: “Do Democrats and Republicans speak differently?”
     “What issues do political candidates focus on in campaign correspondence?”
     “Does `<email attribute>` correlate with winning a political race?” and
     “Does one party speak more positively than another?”
     I anticipate that this dataset will contain close to 25,000 emails by November 2020,
     when I intend to end the collection phase of this research.
