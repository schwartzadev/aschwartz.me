  - title: Intimacies
    author: Katie Kitamura
    stars: 5
    slug: intimacies
    review: >
      Kitamura explores the nature of relationships and human connection as she follows an
      unnamed court interpreter. Kitamura's prose drew me in: the book is devoid of quotation marks,
      which makes the dialogue flow naturally. For me, the plot was almost irrelevant, I'd gladly read
      pretty much anything Kitamura wrote.

      This novel weaves techno-pessimism, biblical references, climate change, and youth into a unique and
      exciting story...I really couldn't put this down and ended up reading it in one day.

  - title: Debate Signups
    description: >-
      md//This is a web app that serves over 200 weekly active users from a local
      high school debate team, implemented in Python on the back-end (with the Django
      Rest Framework and Django server-side rendering) and JQuery on the front-end.
      The site provides an online interface for students and coaches to register for
      competitions with ease, and employs the Django admin site and staff roles so that team
      administrators can manage users, registrations, and models on their own.

      md//[This web app](https://github.com/schwartzadev/flight-2-cal) is a tool to create events on Google Calendar, based off of
      flight codes (i.e. QF9). This app uses Ajax and the [FlightStats API](https://developer.flightstats.com/)
      to generate a view of the flight's information to the user and an external
      button to Google Calendar so that the user can add flights to their calendar.

  - title: Debate Timer
    description: >-
      md//[Debate Timer](https://github.com/schwartzadev/debate-timer), or CX Timer, is a
      desktop timer made for high school and collegiate debate competitions. The timer offers
      debate-specific timing functions to the user and is currently used by members of the
      debate community. The timer is coded in Java (using various Java 8 principles), and uses
      [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) packages for the GUI.

  - title: JSON Cache Module (Python)
    description: >-
      md//[This Python module](https://github.com/schwartzadev/cachejson) gives users the ability to temporarily save, or cache,
      files requested from an API to assist in the development process while
      interfacing with API services that use JSON. Specifically, this assists users in
      efficently developing programs or products without exceeding API (rate) limits in development.

  - title: Combining Word Embeddings for Binary Classification Tasks
    slug: combining-word-embeddings
    description: >-
      md//[This article](Schwartz--Combined-Word-Embeddings--Jan-2020.pdf)
      explores the potential of combining two word-level vector representations,
      or word embeddings, for binary classification Natural Language Processing tasks.
      This research considers [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/),
      [ELMo](https://allennlp.org/elmo), and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) embeddings
      and compares the classification ability of a single embedding with the classification
      ability of the same embedding and an additional embedding on a single data set. Drafted, not published.

  - title: Political Emails Data Set
    slug: political-emails
    description: >-
      md//In January 2020, I began collecting campaign emails from over 600 U.S. House of
      Representatives congressional campaigns. I am currently collecting these emails to
      form a corpus of political emails for use in the Natural Language Processing community.
      I hope this dataset will help answer questions such as: “Do Democrats and Republicans speak differently?”
      “What issues do political candidates focus on in campaign correspondence?”
      “Does `<email attribute>` correlate with winning a political race?” and
      “Does one party speak more positively than another?”
      I anticipate that this dataset will contain close to 25,000 emails by November 2020,
      when I intend to end the collection phase of this research.
      [The code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/schwartzadev/partisanship-db).
      Not drafted, not published.
