 - title: High School Debate Signups
   description: |
    This is a web-app that serves over 200 weekly active users from a local high school debate team,
    implemented in Python on the back-end (with the Django Rest Framework and Django server-side rendering) and JQuery on the front-end.
    The site provides an online interface for students and coaches to register for competitions with ease,
    and employs the Django admin site and staff roles so that team administrators can manage users, registrations, and models on their own.

    Debate Timer, or CX Timer, is a desktop timer made for High School debate competitions.
    The timer simplifies timing by providing a number of highly specific functions to the user.
    The timer is being used by a number of debaters in the high school community and is written in Java
    (using various Java 8 principles, including Lambdas) with Oracle's JavaFX packages for the GUI.

    This Python module gives users the ability to temporarily save, or cache,
    files requested from an API to assist in the development process while interfacing with API services that use JSON.
    Specifically, this assists users in efficently developing programs or products without exceeding API (rate) limits in development.

  - title: Combining Word Embeddings for Binary Classification Tasks
    description: |
      [This article](Schwartz  - Combined Word Embeddings - Jan-2020.pdf) explores the potential of combining two word-level vector representations,
      or word embeddings, for binary classification Natural Language Processing tasks.
      This research considers [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/),
      [ELMo](https://allennlp.org/elmo), and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) embeddings
      and compares the classification ability of a single embedding with the classification
      ability of the same embedding and an additional embedding on a single data set. Drafted, not published.

  - title: Political Emails Data Set
    url: https://github.com/schwartzadev/partisanship-db
    description: |
      In January 2020, I began collecting campaign emails from over 600 U.S. House of Representatives congressional campaigns.
      I am currently collecting these emails to form a corpus of political emails for use in the Natural Language Processing community.
      I believe that this dataset will help answer questions such as:
      "Do Democrats and Republicans speak differently?"
      "What issues do political candidates focus on in campaign correspondence?"
      "Does `<email attribute>` correlate with winning a political race?" and
      "Does one party speak more positively than another?"
      I anticipate that this dataset will contain close to 25,000 emails by November 2020, when I intend to end the collection phase of this research.
      Not drafted, not published.
