My personal website, documenting my projects and skills. View it online [here](http://aschwartz.me)!

## Development

Install all of the dependencies with `npm i`.
Run the development server with `npm run develop`.

## Deployment

`gatsby` is the code branch, and the site builds from `master`. `npm run deploy` will update the `master` branch and push the changes to GitHub.
