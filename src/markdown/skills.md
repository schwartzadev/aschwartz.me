### I prefer to use:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for front-end website development
- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) for API and backend development
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for mockups and wireframes

### I am confident with:

#### Python

I have used Python for a variety of projects, including:

- Full-stack websites using the [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
  (DRF) and server-side rendering
- API development with the Django Rest Framework
- Data analysis and visualization with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`
- Web scraping with `BeautifulSoup`

#### Javascript

I have worked with Javascript on both the front- and back-end. Some Javascript tools that I’ve worked with include:

- React Native for mobile application development
- [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) (which is based on [React](https://reactjs.org/)) for
front-end website development of static sites (like this one!)
- Vanilla [React](https://reactjs.org/) to create web clients
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) and Ajax for various front-end applications

#### Static Site Generators

I am a big fan of sites that run without Javascript. I am very comfortable working with:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator based on Ruby
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator based on Javascript that’s great for rapid prototyping

#### Design Tools

When possible, I prefer to work in vector spaces and with open source tools. I often work with:

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for mockups and wireframes
- Adobe Photoshop for photo editing
- Tableau for exploratory data visualizations
