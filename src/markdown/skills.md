### I prefer to use:

- [Gatsby](gatsbyjs.org) for front-end website development
- Python, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), and Django Rest Framework for full-stack website development
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for mockups and wireframes

### I am confident with:

#### Python

I have used Python for a variety of projects, including:

- Full-stack websites using the [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
  (DRF) and server-side rendering
- API development with the Django Rest Framework
- Data analysis and visualization with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`
- Web scraping with `BeautifulSoup`

#### Javascript

I have worked with Javascript on both the front- and back-end. Some Javascript tools that I’ve worked with include:

- [Gatsby](gatsbyjs.org) (which is based on [React](https://reactjs.org/)) for front-end website development of static sites (like this one!)
- Vanilla [React](https://reactjs.org/) to consume APIs
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) and Ajax for various front-end applications
- Node
- NPM package management

#### Static Site Generators

I am a big fan of sites that run without Javascript. I am very comfortable working in these two platforms:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator based on Ruby
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a Javascript-based static site generator that’s great for rapid prototyping

#### Design Tools

When possible, I prefer to work in vector spaces and with open source tools. I often work with:

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for mockups and wireframes
- Adobe Photoshop for photo editing

#### Miscellaneous

- **Databases**: I almost always prefer to work with an ORM, but I'm comfortable with basic
  SQL and relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL
- **Git**: Love it. I prefer working with GitHub for online/remote version control.
- **Java**: Java is great, but I tend to opt for Python when either language could be used.
